Machine Learning with Python final assignment

This assignment contains different machine learning algorithm implementations, trained and tested with the same dataset to compare performance differences between each algorithm.

We first load the dataset, obtain some initial information, then we pre-process it and visualize the data.

For better results, we normalize and scale the dataset.

The algorithms used in this Jupyter Notebook are:

- K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

Lastly, we test the models and create a table indicating the results.
